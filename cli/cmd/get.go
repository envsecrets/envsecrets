	// Cobra supports Persistent Flags which will work for this command

	// getCmd.PersistentFlags().String("foo", "", "A help for foo")

	// Cobra supports local flags which will only run when this command
	// is called directly, e.g.:
	getCmd.Flags().IntVarP(&version, "version", "v", -1, "Version of your secret")
